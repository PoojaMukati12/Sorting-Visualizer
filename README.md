# 🔍 Sorting Visualizer 

## 📖 Overview:

### Developed the Sorting Visualizer, a web application to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

**->** I combine **web development with DSA** to showcase algorithmic concepts through interactive visualizations.

**->** An exciting, interactive tool that brings algorithms to life right before your eyes.

**->** The project visually demonstrates how these three classic sorting algorithms work.

**->** I built this Sorting Visualizer using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a focus on responsiveness so that **it works seamlessly across all devices, whether on desktop or mobile**.



## 🎯 Aim: 

### -> This project serves as an educational tool to make learning algorithms more intuitive and engaging.


## ✨ Key Features:

### 1. Customizable Sorting Speed: 
**->** Includes a **slider** that allows users to adjust the sorting speed as desired.

### 2. Dynamic Step-by-Step Messages: 
**->** **message Area** that Display concise, engaging messages that guide users through the sorting process, explaining each step clearly.

### 3. Real-Time Visual Effects: 
**->** Includes real-time visualizations that **highlight the sorting process**, making it easier for users to grasp how the sorting algorithms work.

### 4. Responsive Design: 
**->** Provides a seamless experience across all screens, e.g., **desktop** and **mobile devices**.

### 5. Sorting Algorithms:
**->** **Bubble Sort:** Visualizes comparisons and swaps in real-time with smooth transitions.

**->** **Selection Sort:** Highlights the maximum element and its correct placement in each iteration.

**->** **Insertion Sort:** Shows the insertion process step-by-step as elements are placed in their sorted position.
